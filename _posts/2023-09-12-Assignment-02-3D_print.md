## Background 

This assignment requires design and 3D-printing of multiple parts that combine in some way. So for this assignment i am attempting to create a decoratively stand on my desk that rotates a cubic object. Idealy in a slow and aesthetically pleasing way. 


Background for this project is that i 3D-printed the third iteration of a fractal cube and i thought it looked cool so i wanted some way to have it as decoration. Since i have a leftover motor from a arduino startet kit i thought it could be of use. 


## Design 

The idea is based around attaching the cube to the motor and somehow fixing it all in place so it spins perpendicular to the ground. Therefore i would need some sort of stand that encases an arduino (for motor controll), and the motor. Since the cube is going to spin pointy side up, the stand should resemble a pyramid for symmetry. 

The individual parts should include a pyramid with space inside for an arduino and motor, idealy an opening for power supply. A attachment piece for the motor shaft. 


## Motor Shaft

Image of the different design iterations of the motor shaft.

The first few iterations was focused on trying to create a part that fit onto the motor shaft. The shaft has a cog attached to the end which has 10 teeth. The design of this part proved to be a big challenge as i am still not sure how much spacing is required between the gear and the connecting piece. Spacing used in final versions is 0.4mm but i have had prints were i have had to use a knife to make the part fit, while other times it fit too loose.
